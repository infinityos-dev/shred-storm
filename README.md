### **Game Concept**

This game allows players to perform music by pressing the correct notes at the right time, using instruments similar to Guitar Hero. Players will face a variety of songs across multiple genres, with increasing difficulty. The game is focused on rhythm, coordination, and accuracy. The core mechanic is based on matching the notes to the beat of the song, which plays through the game.

### **Gameplay Mechanics**

**1. Core Gameplay Loop:**
   - **Player Input:** Players use a guitar controller or keyboard to hit notes that scroll down the screen.
   - **Note Detection:** Notes appear on-screen in time with the music and move toward a target area. The player must press the corresponding button(s) when the note reaches the target area.
   - **Scoring:** Players earn points based on how accurately they hit the notes (perfect, good, missed).
   - **Combo System:** Consecutive perfect hits build combo points, leading to higher scores and rewards.
   - **Song Progression:** The difficulty of the songs increases as the player progresses, with more complex note patterns, faster speeds, and multiple instruments in play (e.g., drums, vocals).
   
**2. Note Types:**
   - **Single Note:** A single note that corresponds to one input button (e.g., pressing one key or fret).
   - **Chord Notes:** A combination of multiple inputs that the player must hit simultaneously (similar to chords in guitar songs).
   - **Hold Notes:** A note where the player must hold the input for a certain duration.
   - **Slide Notes:** A note where players must slide between two inputs.
   
**3. Player Actions:**
   - **Hit/Play Notes:** Pressing the correct button at the right time.
   - **Miss Notes:** Missing notes will decrease the playerâ€™s score and health.
   - **Special Abilities (Optional):** Players can activate special abilities (e.g., score multipliers or shields) at certain points.
